**Estimating pricing differences for a servered (traditional server-based) architecture versus a serverless architecture, 
specifically for 100,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) in an e-commerce scenario, involves considering various factors. 
Keep in mind that the actual costs can vary based on specific usage patterns, service configurations, and other factors.
Below, I'll outline some key considerations for estimating costs:**

## Servered Architecture (Traditional Server-Based):
Compute Costs:

EC2 Instances: You'll need to estimate the cost of EC2 instances based on the type, size, and number required to handle the expected traffic.
Scaling Considerations:

Auto Scaling: If you implement auto-scaling to handle traffic fluctuations, costs will vary based on the number of instances spun up and down.
Database Costs:

RDS or DynamoDB: Costs associated with your chosen database service for storing and retrieving e-commerce data.
Load Balancer:

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): If you use ELB to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, there will be associated costs.
Monitoring and Logging:

CloudWatch: Costs for monitoring resources and collecting logs.
Data Transfer Costs:

Data Transfer Out: Costs for data transferred out of AWS to the internet.


## Serverless Architecture:
AWS Lambda Costs:

Invocation Costs: Costs associated with the number of Lambda function invocations.
Execution Time: Costs based on the execution time of your functions.
API Gateway Costs:

Request Costs: Charges for the number of API requests made to your serverless API.
Database Costs:

DynamoDB: If you use DynamoDB as a serverless database, costs associated with read and write operations.
EventBridge Costs:

EventBridge Events: If you use EventBridge for event-driven architectures, there will be costs associated with the number of events processed.
Monitoring and Logging:

CloudWatch: Similar to the servered architecture, costs for monitoring and logging.
Data Transfer Costs:

Data Transfer Out: Similar to the servered architecture, costs for data transferred out of AWS to the internet.
Estimating Costs:
To estimate costs more accurately, you can use the AWS Pricing Calculator ([https://calculator.aws.amazon.com/](https://calculator.aws/#/)) and input specific details such as the number of EC2 instances, Lambda invocations, database read/write operations, and other relevant parameters.

Keep in mind that serverless architectures often offer cost advantages due to their pay-as-you-go model, where you only pay for actual usage. However, the complexity of your application and specific requirements will influence the overall cost comparison.

Always check the AWS Pricing page for the most up-to-date pricing information: https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/

Remember that actual costs can vary, and it's advisable to regularly monitor and adjust resources based on changing usage patterns to optimize costs.
