Auto-scaling: Cloud providers like AWS, AZURE, and GCP can automatically adjust the number of instances of your serverless app based on demand, ensuring you have enough resources when needed.

Manual scaling: You can manually increase or decrease instances if you want more control or need to follow a specific schedule for scaling.

Code optimization: Improve your app's efficiency by tweaking the codeâ€”optimize database queries, reduce data transfer, and use caching to lessen the overall workload.

Split workloads: If some parts of your app are busier than others, divide the workload among multiple functions or services to balance the demand.

Managed services: Consider using cloud providers' managed services tailored for serverless apps, which handle scaling and operational tasks for you.

### AWS Serverless Auto-scaling
- AWS provides autoscaling for its serverless offerings, including AWS Lambda and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). 
- With autoscaling, the number of instances of your application is automatically increased or decreased based on demand.
- In the case of AWS Lambda, autoscaling is based on the number of invocations of your function.
- The number of instances of the function is automatically adjusted based on the incoming request rate and the configured concurrency limits.

- For Amazon ECS, autoscaling is based on the number of tasks in the service, and can be configured to scale based on metrics such as CPU utilization or memory usage.

- To set up autoscaling for a serverless application on AWS, you can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. You can specify the minimum and maximum number of instances,
- as well as the conditions under which the number of instances should be increased or decreased.
